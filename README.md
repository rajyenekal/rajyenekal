I'm a **QA Automation Engineer** passionate about delivering high-quality software through effective automation and manual testing. I specialize in using **Selenium**, **Appium**, and **RestAssured** within a hybrid framework for comprehensive testing. I also have a strong focus on **CI/CD** and **DevOps** practices to streamline and enhance the software delivery process.

### 🚀 My Expertise:

#### **Automation Testing**
- **Selenium**: Automates web applications for cross-browser compatibility.
- **Appium**: Automates mobile applications for both Android and iOS.
- **RestAssured**: Performs robust API testing, ensuring APIs are reliable, secure, and performant.

#### **Manual Testing**
- **Exploratory Testing**: Conducts thorough exploratory testing to uncover issues not covered by automated tests.
- **Test Case Execution**: Manually executes test cases to ensure software meets specified requirements and quality standards.

#### **Hybrid Framework**
- **Integrated Testing**: Combines Selenium, Appium, and RestAssured scripts within a single framework, providing a comprehensive testing solution for both web and mobile applications.
- **Configurable & Scalable**: Allows easy switching between different configurations and test environments without altering the core code. Designed with a modular approach to simplify adding new tests and features.
- **Azure Pipelines Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Azure Pipelines, enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). This ensures that tests are automatically executed with each code change, providing rapid feedback and helping catch issues early.
- **Advanced Reporting**: Includes a mail reporting feature that sends detailed test reports after each test run. These reports feature screenshots of failed tests, offering comprehensive insights into test results, errors, and performance.
- **Retry Analyzer**: Enhances test stability and reliability by automatically re-running failed tests a specified number of times before marking them as failed. This feature reduces the impact of flaky tests and ensures more consistent results.

#### **Skills**
- **Java & Python**: Writes efficient, reusable test scripts.
- **API Testing**: Uses RestAssured for thorough API testing.
